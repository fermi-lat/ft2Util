* @brief Use this class to access all the information about the spacecraft pointing and position.

This class represents the core of the package. Provided an FT2 file, it gives easy
access to all the information about the position of the spacecraft, and about the pointing of
both the spacecraft and the LAT, at a given time.

Basically you have to instantiate the class givin the FT2 file name as input. Then, using the
operator (), you can obtain all the information given a time (in MET).

See the main page of the Doxygen documentation of the package for an example.
